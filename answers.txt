1)What is a gitignore ﬁle and what should it include for a Java project?
=>Git uses gitignore to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit. A .gitignore file should be committed
into your repository, in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository.
For a java project it should include:-
# Compiled class file
*.class

# Log file
*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

# virtual machine crash logs,
hs_err_pid*


2)What does fast-forward in Git mean?
=>If Master has not diverged, instead of creating a new commit, git will just point master to the latest commit of the feature branch.
 This is a “fast forward.”

3)Why should you have diﬀerent branches?
=>In real-world projects, work always happens in parallel, Using branches help you organize the workflow more efficiently
and rather effortlessly. And if there occurs a problem in one branch you can solve the problem independent of other branches.

4)In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
=>IT differs from project to project, but usually it is one remote git repository.
